## The App

Our single page application is built using React and fetches data from the Open Weather Api.

The main functionality we wanted to offer is an overview of the weather for the week ahead with the possibility of expanding a date to show more detailed information. 

Our main focus with this project was offering a smooth user journey through a simple and intuitive UI.
